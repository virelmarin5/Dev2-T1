/*
 * Script: HeartbeatManager
 * Author: Devin Childs
 *
 * Description:
 * Controls the player's heartbeat and stress system.
 * Instead of taking traditional health damage, the player builds stress
 * through combat actions such as taking damage, firing weapons, and
 * experiencing dangerous situations. As stress increases, the player's
 * BPM (beats per minute) rises. If the BPM reaches the maximum value,
 * the player loses the game due to cardiac overload.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Track current stress level.
 * - Calculate the player's current BPM.
 * - Gradually reduce stress over time.
 * - Increase or decrease stress based on gameplay events.
 * - Notify the GameManager of BPM changes.
 * - Check the lose condition when BPM reaches its maximum.
 *
 * Interacts With:
 * - playerController (player takes damage / fires weapon)
 * - waveManager (wave completion)
 * - Enemy scripts (enemy defeated)
 * - gameManager (updates BPM UI and triggers lose state)
 *
 * Last Updated:
 * Prototype 1
